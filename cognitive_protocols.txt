Scenarios:

Op is actively monitoring alignment, and mouse is on the correct virtual button.
Op is actively monitoring alignment, and mouse is on the wrong virtual button.
Op is passively monitoring alignment, and mouse is on the correct virtual button.
Op is passively monitoring alignment, and mouse is on the wrong virtual button.
Ditto with keys (another 4) and the last keystroke was the same (or not).

The transition from passive to active monitoring costs 500ms

Functional acutity is worse in passive monitoring. (cognitive zoom)
Practical acuity ((functional acuity = graphical availabity * cog zoom) * decision processes/threhsold)
   How to decide to respond.
(101 vs. 280) hot and cold cognition


Active/Passive monitoring
Mouse/(Keys)
Last same/Last different

Active+Stick   :
Active+Change  :
Passive+Stick  : Passive is most common case (The problem with car phones)
Passive+Change :
(OffTask+Stick) Maybe useful to model (Meng&Paul mentioned bothering the operator)
(OffTask+Change)

In offtask there is an additional start-actively-moitoring both cognitive and eye-movment (arbitrarily long)
